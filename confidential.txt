RENAME USER 'root'@'localhost' TO 'root'@'%';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%';

step-9:
Test the MySql server if it is working by running sample sql queries
CREATE DATABASE mysql_test;

USE mysql_test;

CREATE TABLE table1 (id INT, name VARCHAR(45));

INSERT INTO table1 VALUES(1, 'Virat'), (2, 'Sachin'), (3, 'Dhoni'), (4, 'ABD');

SELECT * FROM table1;


step-10:
check user list
SELECT user,plugin,host from mysql.user;
